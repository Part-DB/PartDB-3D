# PartDB-3D
The 3D-Footprints for Part-DB converted from KiCAD 3D-Footprints. They are seperate from the main application because they are very big and maybe not every user will need them.

## Installation
Copy (or clone) the Folders you want to use as 3D model into the "models" folder of your Part-DB 0.4.0+ setup.
